## Description
The National Parks Planner is a server-side API driven web app to provide users with a list of national parks of a selected state and trails in the the selected area.

Utilization of local storage allows users to create a personal account and track which parks they have visited.

Future development of this app would include expansion of the personal account, allowing a user to store information on parks they would like to visit and plan an itinerary for that park.

## Usage
Upon opening the [National Park Planner](), the user is presented with an introduction to the page. Clicking the "Try Now" button in the welcome section directs the user to the search form where they may select a U.S. state. Clicking the "Search" button generates a list of national parks within the selected state, links to the official page of the respective park, and trails in/near that park.
